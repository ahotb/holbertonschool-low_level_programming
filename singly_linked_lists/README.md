# Singly Linked Lists
A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:

## Some data
A pointer to the next node in the sequence
The last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.

Unlike arrays, linked lists:

Grow and shrink dynamically
Allow efficient insertion and deletion
Do not require contiguous memory
This implementation includes basic operations like:

Creating a new node
Adding a node at the end
Printing the list
Freeing the entire list
